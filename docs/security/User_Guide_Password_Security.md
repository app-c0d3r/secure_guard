- Include at least one lowercase letter (a-z)

#### "Password change required"
**Scenario**: Cannot access any features until password changed
**Solution**:
- Complete the mandatory password change process

## üí° Best Practices

3. **Password Manager**: Use a password manager to generate unique passwords
   - Recommended: 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass

#### What to Avoid

- ‚ùå Keyboard patterns (qwerty, 123456)
- ‚ùå Reusing passwords from other accounts
- ‚ùå Writing passwords down in unsecured locations
