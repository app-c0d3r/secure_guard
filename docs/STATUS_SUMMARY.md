2. Configure API service layer in frontend
3. Implement authentication integration
4. Replace mock data with real API calls
5. Add WebSocket for real-time updates
```

### Option B: Frontend Enhancement
**Goal**: Add advanced features to current frontend
```bash
# Advanced frontend features:
1. Enhanced UI animations and transitions
2. Advanced data visualization components
3. Improved mobile responsiveness
4. Additional security features
5. Performance optimizations
```

### Option C: Production Deployment
**Goal**: Deploy frontend as standalone application
```bash
# Production deployment:
1. Build optimization and bundling
2. Docker containerization
3. CI/CD pipeline setup
4. Performance monitoring
5. Security hardening
```

### 🚀 Integration Steps (When Ready)
```bash
# If backend development is needed:
# 1. Install Visual Studio Build Tools
# 2. Set up PostgreSQL database
# 3. Configure Rust environment
# 4. Connect frontend to API

# Current frontend is ready for immediate integration
```
