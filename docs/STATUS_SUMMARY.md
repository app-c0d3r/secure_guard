### 🎯 Next Development Priorities

### Option A: Backend Integration (Recommended)
**Goal**: Connect frontend to existing Rust API
```bash
# Steps for backend integration:
1. Set up Rust development environment (if needed)
2. Configure API service layer in frontend
3. Implement authentication integration
4. Replace mock data with real API calls
5. Add WebSocket for real-time updates
```

### Option B: Frontend Enhancement
**Goal**: Add advanced features to current frontend
```bash
# Advanced frontend features:
1. Enhanced UI animations and transitions
2. Advanced data visualization components
3. Improved mobile responsiveness
4. Additional security features
5. Performance optimizations
```

### Option C: Production Deployment
**Goal**: Deploy frontend as standalone application
```bash
# Production deployment:
1. Build optimization and bundling
2. Docker containerization
3. CI/CD pipeline setup
4. Performance monitoring
5. Security hardening
```

### 🚀 Integration Steps (When Ready)
```bash
# If backend development is needed:
# 1. Install Visual Studio Build Tools
# 2. Set up PostgreSQL database
# 3. Configure Rust environment
# 4. Connect frontend to API

# Current frontend is ready for immediate integration
```
