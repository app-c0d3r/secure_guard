1. System Overview & Core Principles

1.1 Architecture Vision

The system is a Cloud-Native Microservices Architecture with a lightweight agent-based approach. The solution combines the scalability of cloud platforms with real-time communication, implemented in Rust for maximum performance and security.

1.2 Core Principles

    Security by Design: All components are developed with a security-first mindset.

    Performance First: Aims for sub-100ms API response times and under 50MB of RAM usage per agent.

    Scalability: Horizontally scalable to support 10,000+ agents.

    Reliability: Aims for 99.9% uptime and automated failover mechanisms.

    Privacy Compliance: GDPR-compliant data processing and data minimization principles.

    KISS-Principle: Simplicity, stability, and resource efficiency guide all decisions.

1.3 High-Level Architecture

The architecture is divided into layers, from a central API Gateway to the application and data layers.

2. Technology Stack

2.1 Backend Technology Stack

    Runtime: Rust 1.75+ for memory safety, performance, and concurrency.

    Web Framework: Axum 0.7+ for a modern, async, and performant approach.

    Database: PostgreSQL 15+ for ACID compliance and JSON support.

    Cache: Redis 7+ for in-memory caching and pub/sub capabilities.

    Message Queue: Redis Streams 7+ for a lightweight, built-in, and persistent message queue.

2.2 Agent Technology Stack

The agent will be developed in Rust. Platform-specific libraries like winapi and windows will be used for Windows development. MessagePack (rmp-serde) will be used for serialization, and zstd or lz4_flex for compression to reduce data transfer size.

2.3 Frontend Technology Stack

    Framework: React 18+ with Vite for fast builds and modern tooling.

    UI Library: Tailwind CSS 3+ for a utility-first and customizable UI.

    State Management: Zustand 4+ for a simple and lightweight state management solution.

2.4 Infrastructure & DevOps

    Containerization: Docker will be used with multi-stage builds.

    Orchestration: Kamal will be used for simple and cost-effective deployment.

    CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and builds.

    Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive monitoring.

    Infrastructure as Code: Terraform will be used to provision the infrastructure.

2.5 IDE Configuration (VSCode)

Recommended extensions are rust-lang.rust-analyzer, serayuzgur.crates, and ms-vscode.vscode-json. The configuration should enable format-on-save and enforce a line width of 100 characters.

3. Agent Architecture

3.1 Agent Identification & Lifecycle

Each agent gets a unique agent_id and a hardware-based hardware_fingerprint for authentication. The fingerprint is generated from a combination of CPU, motherboard, and MAC address information to prevent duplicate registrations.

3.2 Hybrid Communication Model

To ensure maximum responsiveness with minimal overhead, a hybrid approach is used:

    Heartbeat Service (Pull-Principle): The agent sends regular heartbeats (e.g., every 5 minutes) to signal its status and check for basic commands. This is the primary mechanism for the cloud to detect if an agent is online or offline.

    WebSocket Connection (Push-Principle): A persistent, bidirectional WebSocket connection is maintained for real-time command & control. This allows the server to instantly send commands to the agent (e.g., "quarantine file") without waiting for the next heartbeat.

4. Backend Architecture

4.1 Service-Oriented Architecture

The backend is structured into specialized services like AgentService, ThreatService, and UserService, with each service responsible for a specific domain. This promotes modularity and maintainability.

4.2 Database Schema Architecture

The database is organized into separate schemas (tenants, agents, threats, users) for clear data separation. The threats.security_events table is partitioned by time to ensure efficient querying of large datasets.

5. Security & Compliance

5.1 Defense-in-Depth & Zero-Trust

The security architecture relies on a multi-layered defense and a Zero-Trust model, where all requests are authenticated and authorized.

5.2 Authentication & Authorization

Authentication is handled via JWT tokens. Authorization uses a Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) model with granular permissions for different user roles (admin, analyst, user). The PasswordService uses Argon2 for password hashing, and the system is protected against common attacks like brute-force and DDoS.

5.3 Data Protection

Sensitive data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database.

5.4 GDPR Compliance

The system is designed to be GDPR-compliant from the start, with built-in functionalities for the Right of Access, the Right to Erasure, and data portability. Data retention policies will automatically delete or anonymize old data.

6. Performance & Scalability

6.1 Performance Requirements

The performance goals are ambitious: API response times under 100ms, agent CPU usage under 1%, and RAM usage under 50MB.

6.2 Caching Strategy

A two-tier caching strategy is employed: an in-memory L1 cache per instance and a distributed L2 Redis cache. This ensures fast access to frequently requested data.

6.3 Database Optimization

PostgreSQL performance will be optimized through strategic indexing, efficient query building, and data partitioning to handle large volumes of events.

7. Testing & Quality Assurance

7.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The project will follow a TDD approach. Tests will be written first to define the desired behavior before implementation.

    Unit Tests: For core logic and functions.

    Integration Tests: For component interactions, like API and database communication.

    Property-based Testing: To test with a large range of generated inputs.

7.2 Code Quality Standards

Code style will be enforced using rustfmt, and the clippy linter will be used to catch common errors. A consistent naming convention will be followed: PascalCase for types, snake_case for functions/variables, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

8. Implementation

8.1 Rust Coding Standards

The project adheres to specific Rust coding standards for clear, maintainable code. This includes using thiserror for custom error types and anyhow for error context.

8.2 Database Standards

Database migrations will be managed with sqlx-cli. Queries will use sqlx's parameterized query builder to prevent SQL injection.
