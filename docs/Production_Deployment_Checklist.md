- [ ] Admin account created with secure random password

**Verification Commands:**
```sql
-- Check migration status
SELECT * FROM _sqlx_migrations ORDER BY version;

-- Verify password policy table
SELECT * FROM users.password_policies;

-- Test password validation function
SELECT users.validate_password_strength('TestPass123!', 12, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE);
